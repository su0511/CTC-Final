  <div class="content">
    <span>Desire is a chain around the neck.</span>
    <span>Gold shone in his dreams and clouded his soul.</span>
    <span>Soft laughter drew him deeper into the maze.</span>
    <span>The fragrance of wealth dulled the river’s whisper.</span>
    <span>Greedy hands gathered illusions.</span>
    <span>He forgot the songs of birds and the stars’ embrace.</span>
    <span>His smile became hollow, his heart a closed jar.</span>
    <span>Wandering between silken beds and golden coins.</span>
    <span>Each pleasure consumed, another thirst awakened.</span>
    <span>The river was lost behind walls of noise.</span>
    <span>He sold his peace for games and silk robes.</span>
    <span>The taste of wine dulled the voice of awakening.</span>
    <span>He who sought freedom became the most bound.</span>
    <span>Days passed in golden blindness.</span>
    <span>The boy who loved trees now bartered lives.</span>
    <span>His dreams bled dry under velvet nights.</span>
    <span>The river, once near, now faded into silence.</span>
    <span>In the depths of pleasure, he drowned unseen.</span>
    <span>Despair clung to his shadow like a second skin.</span>
    <span>The river waited patiently, speaking only to silence.</span>
